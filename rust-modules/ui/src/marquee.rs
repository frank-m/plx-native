//! **The focused run's marquee** — one looping glide for a single line of text that does not fit
//! its window: a beat of rest so the couch can start reading, a slow glide left, a gap, then the
//! same run re-entering from the right, forever while it holds focus.
//!
//! Two users, one implementation (`ui/src/CLAUDE.md` rule 4): a focused tile's title under its
//! card (`card_row`, [`TITLE`]) and a focused menu row's label (`table`, [`ROW`]) — a downloaded
//! subtitle's release name is routinely three times the width of the track menu. They differ only
//! in the rest beat, and each keeps its OWN [`Clock`], because a popover menu over a shelf draws
//! both focused runs in one frame and a shared clock would restart on every draw.
//!
//! Draw TWO copies at `x - offset` and `x - offset + text_w + GAP` (the follower), both clipped to
//! the window — the follower is what makes the wrap seamless instead of a visible pop back to the
//! start: by the time `offset` reaches the full travel distance the follower has arrived exactly
//! where the primary run started, so the loop boundary is invisible.
